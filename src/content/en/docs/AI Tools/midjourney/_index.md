## What is Midjourney
From the website:
> Midjourney is an independent research lab exploring new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species.

However, when we refer to Midjourney on this website, we mean the Midjourney Discord Bot. Currently, the Midjourney generative AI is only available through Discord. Interacting with the software is done by adding this bot to your Discord channel or chatting with the bot directly.

## How to use Midjourney
The Quick Start is available [here][2].

The Pro and Mega plan offer [Stealth Mode][3]. This mode prevents your generated content from publicly appearing on Midjourney's website. This mode is not enabled by default.

## License / Costs
Midjourney has several [subscription plans][1]. From the docs:
> You must purchase the Pro or Mega plan if you are a company making more than $1,000,000 USD in gross revenue per year.

This website focusses on workflows to actually get things done instead of tools. When using AI tools they often require licenses and some might not be suitable to work with client data. Are you using a specific tool create a page on a couple of things:

- What is the tool?
- how to use it?
- What is the license?
- Is it suitable to be used at clients
- Is there a Xebia managed solution / alternative you could use?
- If the tool can be used at clients how to convince your client to use it. what is the proof that this tool is safe to use, will not steal data, etc. Colleagues can use this proof to have conversations with clients.

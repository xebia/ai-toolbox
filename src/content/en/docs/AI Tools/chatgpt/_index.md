## What is ChatGPT
ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) is an artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI.

## How to use ChatGPT
You can visit [the website][2] to have a conversation with ChatGPT.

## License / Costs
While ChatGPT is free, you can opt for a ChatGPT Plus license. It enables the following:

- General access to ChatGPT, even during peak times
- Faster response times
- Priority access to new features and improvements

## Suitable to use with clients?
In general, no. ChatGPT stores all your conversations, including all the data you sent to ChatGPT. You can turn off this feature but still you're sending sensitive data to OpenAI.

If you need a safer chat-like experience backed by a GPT model, try Xebia's [SlackGPT][1]. This application uses a paid endpoint, which ensures your data is not used to train the GPT models.

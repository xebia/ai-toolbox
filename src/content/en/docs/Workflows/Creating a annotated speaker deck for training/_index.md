## Introduction
When you create a PowerPoint deck that can be used in a training or other sort of multi-delivery, it is hard to capture the story you want to convey in slides only. What do ou tell at every slide, what are the talking points and what story line do you want to follow. When you deliver the presentation yourself, this is doable, but what if someone else needs to use your deck? Or you deliver a training deck to a customer. For example, a customer wants a deck they can use for training their people. Then you want to annotate the slides with speaker notes, the story you want to tell so that people can read it, and the talking points so people can create their own story without losing the storyline.

No better way to capture this by recording the presentation right? Right! Bu that does not really scale well when preparing or delivering. So you want your story in the speaker notes.. But that is a lot of work! Yes indeed. And that is where this workflow comes in

## Step 1: Deliver your presentation to your recording device
Deliver the presentation. On Windows, use the audio recorder and deliver your story as you would do it in a training or presentation. Start every new slide with <Slide 1>, <Slide 2> 

## Step 2: Create a transcript with Whisper AI
The audio file, wav, m4a etc has all the content. Install WhisperAI and run the tool by using the commandline

```
whisper youraudio.m4a --model medium 
```

You can mention teh language, although whisper can detect this as well. It can take some time to do this. As a workaround, create a VM in the cloud and let it run there.


## Step 3: Style it

With the transcript that is generated by WhisperAI you can go to SlackGPT and use the following prompt per slide (manual copy paste)

```
I'll provide you with a transcript. You will start with a header "Talking Points" and then need to summarize the transcript into bullet points and a short descriptive text of the point underneath. The description of talking points need to be in blog style. Described as an outside observer. Write clear and use imperative tone. Only use information that is provided in the transcript.
Then, add a header "speaker text" and write a text that someone can read to present this to an audience. Do not use announcer speech or things as today. Treat this as it is in the middle of a presentation
Here is the transcript:

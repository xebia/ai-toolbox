  How can ChatGPT help you with your presentations?
---

## Step 1: Open the Visual Basic Editor

Windows:

Go to Developer[^enable-developer] > Visual Basic

Mac:

Go to Tools > Macro > Visual Basic Editor

Next insert a Module: Insert > Module

## Step 2: Ask ChatGPT to do your homework

Next up we are going to ask ChatGPT to generate a Visual Basic script that will generate a presentation for us. This is mostly Prompt engineering.

Weather you know or you don't know your presentation out-line your prompt should probably start with something like this:

    Generate VBA script in PowerPoint that on execution generates slides.
    The Topic of the slide deck is: [The benefits of having ChatGPT do you work]
    The length of the slide deck is: [Minimum of 10 slides]
    
    Think like a C# developer that is trying to save his job by giving this presentation
    make sure to generate sub points on all the slides

Run the script.

## Step 3: Style it

All that is left is to style your slides, if you don't have a house-style design you can use the Integrated feature of PowerPoint "Designer" that should be located on the Home Ribbon.

[^enable-developer]: If you don't see the Developer "Ribbon" follow these steps:

    - Go to File > Options
    - Customize Ribbon
    - Main Tabs > Developer
    - Ok

# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

## Content guidelines

Make sure all content you contribute is in a readable state. Pages should have enough content to be useful but you don't have to write all the details if you don't have time or knowledge to add that. We can always add more content later.

If content / guides on using certain tools is found by other creators on the internet please do add a link back to them. We don't want to steal content from others, this website is just to empower everyone within Xebia to use these tools and provide a central place to find information on it.
